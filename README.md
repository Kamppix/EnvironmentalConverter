# Pixel Music Packer

A tool creating Minecraft music packs compatible with the [Environmental Music](https://github.com/Kamppix/EnvironmentalMusic) mod. You can choose to either use your own music files or get them from a YouTube playlist or a Terraria music pack.

#### Downloading from YouTube works very poorly. You might want to use an external tool for this.
